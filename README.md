# liri-node-app

Hi There! 

So just about all the functionality is working properly with the exception of the "concert-this" command. When prompted, the concert venue, concert time and location show. I'm not sure why the entire ojbect posts though... that's the next thing to figure out though. I ran through my time for screencastify, so the screen shots are in descending order showing the Liri functionality.
